##### Insert
INSERT INTO table (column0, ...)
VALUES
(value0, ....);

INSERT INTO "collections" ("id", "title", "accession_number", "acquired")
   ...> VALUES
        (1, 'Profusion of flowers', '56.27', '1956-04-12');

-- What if we dont specify the id then it automatically increment the value
-- of "id" (primary key)

# Insert multiple rows
INSERT INTO table (column0, ...)
VALUES
(value0, ....),
(value1, ....),
(value2, ....);

-- How to load data stored in csv file
.import --csv --skip 1 mfa.csv collections ("this is not sql statement this SQLite statement no "collections")
--we dont want header row in our database so we skip it


-- How if we want sqlite to generate the primary keys
.import --csv mfa.csv temp --this makes a new table named temp
-- All data imported from csv is in TEXT format

INSERT INTO table0 (column0, ....)
SELECT column0 ,.. FROM table1;

INSERT INTO "collections" ("title", "accession_number", "acquired")
SELECT "title", "accession_number", "acquired" FROM "temp";

-- A blank cell when imported form csv will not show up as NULL we need to update it later.


##### Delete
DELETE FROM "collections"; -- this deletes the whole table

DELETE FROM "collections" WHERE "title" = 'Some title';
DELETE FROM "collections" WHERE "acquired" IS NULL; --deletes all null values in acquired column

-- Multiple rows deletion
DELETE FROM "collections" WHERE "id" >= 4;
DELETE FROM "collections" WHERE "acquired" < '1909-01-01';


############ Foreign Key constraints
--If you delete primary key, the other table foreign key does not have any reference.
-- So we first delete the reference key then the primary key.

.shema table_name --to only ssee pecific table

FOREIGN KEY("artist_id") REFERENCES "artists"("id")
ON DELETE RESTRICT  --restrict deletion of primary key referenced by the foreign key
ON DELETE NO ACTION
ON DELETE SET NULL  -- if i delete the primary key referenced by the foreign key set it to NULL
ON DELETE DEFAULT
ON DELETE CASCADE -- if i delete the primary key then the foreign key is also deleted.

##### Update ####
UPDATE "created" SET "atists_id" = (
        SELECT "id" FROM "artists"
        WHERE "name" = 'Li Yin'
)
WHERE "collection_id" = (
        SELECT "id" FROM "collections"
        WHERE "title" = 'Farmers working at dawn'
)

UPDATE "votes" SET "title" = trim("title"); --to remove white space
UPDATE "votes" SET "title" = upper("title"); -- to convert into upper case, the are scaler function
UPDATE "votes" SET "title" = 'FARMERS WORKING AT DAWN' WHERE "title" LIKE 'Fa%'; -- the 'fa' is case-insensitive

######## Scaler function
upper()
lower()

######## Triggers #######
-- if you delete/add row from 1 table and it enters into other table

CREATE TRIGGER name
BEFORE/AFTER UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE
 " INSERT ON table
 " UPDATE OF column ON table
 " DELETE ON table

 FOR EACH ROW
 BEGIN
        ...;
END;

CREATE TRIGGER "sell"
BEFORE DELETE ON "Collections"
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
        INSERT INTO "transactions" ("title", "action")
        VALUES (OLD."title", 'sold');
END;

CREATE TRIGGER "buy"
AFTER INSERT ON "collections"
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
       INSERT INTO "transactions" ("title", "action")
       VALUES (NEW."title", 'bought');
END;


#### Soft Deletions #####


ALTER TABLE "collections" ADD COLUMN "deleted" INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
