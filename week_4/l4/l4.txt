########################## LECTURE 4: Viewing #########################

--View
A virtual table defined by query, this does not require any extra storage space.

- simplyfying
- aggregation
- Partioning
- Securing


############## Simplfying ##############
- After joining multiple tables, we can create a view to save the result to query them later on
CREATE VIEW name AS
SELECT ....;

CREATE VIEW "longlist" AS
SELECT
    "name", "title" FROM "authors"
JOIN
    "authored" ON "authors"."id" = "authored"."author_id",
    "books" ON "books"."id" = "authored"."book_id";


########### Aggregation ############
CREATE VIEW "average_book_ratings" AS
SELECT "book_id", ROUND(AVG("rating"), 2) AS "Average Rating", "year", "title" FROM "ratings"
JOIN "books" ON "books"."id" = "ratings"."book_id"
GROUP BY "book_id";


--- Create Temporary View, only exists till the connection with the database is open

- we can use 1 view to create another new view.
CREATE TEMPORARY VIEW ...

CREATE VIEW temp."average_rating_by_year" AS
SELECT "year", "Average Rating" FROM "average_book_ratings"
GROUP BY "year"

-- CTE (Common Table Expression), exists only for the duration of the single query
WITH "average_book_ratings" AS (
    SELECT "book_id", "title", "year", ROUND(AVG("rating"), 2) AS "rating"
    FROM "ratings"
    JOIN "books" ON "ratings"."book_id" = "books"."id"
    GROUP BY "book_id"
 )
 SELECT "year", ROUND(AVG("rating"), 2) AS "rating"
 FROM "average_book_ratings"
 GROUP BY "year";


-- View
DROP VIEW "average_book_ratings";


############### Partitioning ##############
- We can partition the data into multiple views, to make it easier to query
- We can use the WHERE clause to filter the data


CREATE VIEW "2022" AS
SELECT "id", "title" FROM "books"
WHERE "year" = 2022

-- We cannot update/insert/delete data in the view, we need to update the table itself


############ Securing ######################

- We need to hide PII (personaly identifiable information)

CREATE VIEW "analysis" AS
SELECT "id", "origin", "destination", 'Anonymous' AS "rider" FROM "rides"

-- In sqlite we cannot set access control


########## Soft Deletions ##########

-- to update view we need to create trigger

CREATE TRIGGER name
INSTEAD OF DELETE ON view
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    ...;
END;

CREATE TRIGGER "delete"
INSTEAD OF DELETE ON "current_collections"
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    UPDATE "collections" SET "deleted" = 1 WHERE "id" = OLD."id";
END;


-- Trigger aso have conditional usage

CREATE TRIGGER name
INSTEAD OF INSERT ON view
FOR EACH ROW
WHEN condition
BEGIN


CREATE TRIGGER "insert"
INSTEAD OF INSERT ON "current_collections"
FOR EACH ROW
WHEN NEW."accession_number" IN (SELECT "accession_number" FROM "collections")
BEGIN
    UPDATE "collections" SET "deleted" = 0
    WHERE "accession_number" = NEW."accession_number";
END;


######################   EXTRA STUFF ###############################

####### PIVOTING
SELECT <columns> FROM
(
	<source_query>
) AS SRC
PIVOT
(
	<aggr_function>(<aggr_column>)
		FOR <spreading_column> IN (<spreading_elements>)
)

###### Window Functions (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xMWEVFC4FOk)
- ROW_NUMBER() OVER(PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY)  
- RANK() OVER()
- DENSE_RANK() OVER()
- CONCAT()
- CASE WHEN THEN ELSE (for pivot in MySql)
- LENGTH()
- REGEXP
- CAST( AS DATE)  (to convert to different data type)	
- RIGHT(name, 1) (get the first letter from the right
- LIKE 'Gre_n'
- YEAR(date) (to get the year from the date)
- COALESCE(value, 0)  (if value is NULL then outputs 0
