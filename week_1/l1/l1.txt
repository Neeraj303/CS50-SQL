(ISBN) unique identifier: unqiue for each key (Primary Key) 
Foreign Key (if you else this key in other table)

Joint table/junction table (consists of id for each value in the multiple tables)
 
# SUBQUERIES / NESTED QUERIES

## keyword
IN (to check if a value is in a list of values)

##### JOIN tables (take 1 table and join it with other table)
- JOIN (in general inner join)
- LEFT OUTER JOIN: priortize the left/ first tale. If the value is not present in the right table, it will still show the value from the left table.
- RIGHT OUTER JOIN: priortize the right/ second tale. If the value is not present in the left table, it will still show the value from the right table.
- FULL OUTER JOIN: show all the values from both the tables.
- NATURAL JOIN: join the tables based on the common column name. (it will not show the common column twice in the output)

#1. INNER JOIN
SELECT * FROM "sea_lions"
JOIN "migrations" ON "migrations"."id" = "sea_lions"."id";

#2. LEFT JOIN
SELECT * FROM "sea_lions"
LEFT JOIN "migrations" ON "migrations"."id" = "sea_lions"."id";

#3. RIGHT JOIN
SELECT * FROM "sea_lions"
RIGHT JOIN "migrations" ON "migrations"."id" = "sea_lions"."id";

#4. FULL JOIN
SELECT * FROM "sea_lions"
FULL JOIN "migrations" ON "migrations"."id" = "sea_lions"."id";

#5. NATURAL JOIN (this does not output id column 2 times in the output)
SELECT * FROM "sea_lions" 
NATURAL JOIN "migrations";


###### Sets

#1. INTERSECT
SELECT "name" FROM "authors"
INTERSECT
SELECT "name" FROM "translators";

#2. UNiON
SELECT "name" FROM "translators"
UNION 
SELECT "name" FROM "authors";

#3. EXCEPT
SELECT "name" FROM "authors"
EXCEPT
SELECT "name" FROM "translators";

#4. 
SELECT "name" FROM "authors"
UNION 
SELECT "name" FROM "translators"
EXCEPT  
SELECT "name" FROM "authors"
INTERSECT
SELECT "name" FROM "translators";


SELECT "author" AS "Profession", "name" FROM "authors"
UNION
SELECT "translator" AS "Profession", "name" FROM "translators";



####### Group by 
SELECT "book_id", AVG("rating") AS "Average Rating"
FROM "ratings"
GROUP BY "book_id";


# Usage of WHERE when GROUP BY used: HAVING
SELECT "book_id", ROUND(AVG("rating"), 2) AS "average rating"
FROM "ratings"
GROUP BY "book_id"
HAVING "average rating" > 4.0;


SELECT "book_id", COUNT("book_id") AS "Rating Count"
FROM "ratings"
GROUP BY "book_id";

1. you can only GROUP BY columns that are included in SELECT clause.
